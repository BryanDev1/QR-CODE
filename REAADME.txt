On this projet i leaned more about css propreties like Margin, Padding and others.Theres many others css propreties.
For the HTML i've learned more about de link and font family that we can use from the internet.

In building this projet i found diffcult to found the good css to use for it.
The best practices is to try again and again and over again trying to find the solution is the best thing for me i think  to  be better
